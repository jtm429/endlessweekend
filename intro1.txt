dia::::It's your first day at a new elementary school. You haven't really made any friends here yet
dia::::There's one group of kids playing kickball on one side of the playground, and a girl watching the ants on the other.
que::::where do you go?
cho:::Play kickball with the group
dia::::More likely to find friends with more kids around.
dia::::You approach and the team leaders begin arguing. They turn to you.
dia:Morgan::smug:Surely you don't want to join a losing team.
dia:Leo::annoyed:She's already winning. It's not fair to give them an extra player. 
dia:Morgan::smug:It's not like it even matters in Kickball.
que:Leo:::You decide then, whose team do you want to join?
cho:It's not fair to me to be losing before I ever get to play
dia:Morgan::happy:I knew you'd make the right choice.

cho:::It's only fair I should choose Leo's side
dia:Morgan::annoyed:Your loss, losers
dia:Leo::smug:Don't worry. We'll turn it around from here.

dia:Leo:::We're only down by one, so we need two points
cqu:Leo:::Alright, here's what we're going to do...
car:analysis:1::Fake them out?
dia:Leo::happy:Exactly, kick it really close to load a base,
dia:Leo::happy:then when the next person goes up, kick it as hard as possible. 
que:Leo:::so do you want to be on base or the kicker?
cho:::I'll be on base, and you'll kick
dia::::Leo nods. The first part of the plan goes off without a hitch. 
dia::::You lightly tap the ball, and run to the first base as they scramble for it. 
dia::::Leo kicks it, but not far enough. 
dia::::As you make it through, you turn to see Leo getting pegged in the back.
inc:0:mind:2 
dia:Morgan::happy:I'm impressed, you managed to tie it up. 
fla:morgan_childhood_friend:1

cho:::You get on base, and I'll kick
dia::::Leo nods. The first part of the plan goes off without a hitch. 
dia::::He lightly tap the ball, and runs to the first base as they scramble for it. 
dia::::Your turn: you approach the plate, and the ball rolls towards you. 
dia::::It's lighter than you expected. The ball soars over the fence. 
dia:Oscar::happy:Whoa, nice shot!
dia::::The new boy Oscar wasn't on either of the teams, instead he seemed to materialize within the chaos.
dia:Morgan::angry:Nice shot? Come on, that doesn't count!
dia:Morgan::angry:We can't even retake the lead because there's no ball!
dia:Oscar::smug:Come on, you're just jealous you couldn't make a shot like that. 
dia::::The ball wasn't really GONE, but it would have to be brought in by a teacher. 
dia::::Morgan storms off.
dia:Leo::smug:Don't worry about her, she's just a sore loser.
inc:0:mind:1
inc:0:body:1
dia:Oscar:::Yeah, she'll get over it.

car:eloquence:1::Rally the troops?
dia:Leo::happy:Not exactly how I would put it, but yeah
dia:Leo:::Look, we can win this if we just work together. We just need to squeak two more runs out to put us ahead. 

end:pass
